# How has the relationship between female and male per capita consumption evolved in Belarus between 2000 and 2020?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), this study examines the evolution of gendered alcohol consumption in Belarus between 2000 and 2020. Over this twenty-year period, male per capita consumption consistently exceeded female consumption by a large margin, with men drinking roughly four times more on average. While both series displayed only modest fluctuations—forming a slight inverted U-shape with a rise between 2006 and 2012 followed by a decline—male consumption exhibited sharper swings, suggesting a higher sensitivity to economic or social changes. This persistent gender gap underscores the importance of considering cultural, behavioral, and policy dimensions in understanding consumption dynamics, as aggregate measures alone can obscure meaningful intra-population disparities.

## 1. Question

How has the relationship between female and male per capita consumption evolved in Belarus between 2000 and 2020?

- **Female proxy**: Female alcohol consumption per capita
- **Male proxy**: Male alcohol consumption per capita

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Alcohol consumption, per capita (female, liters of pure alcohol)
  - Alcohol consumption, per capita (male, liters of pure alcohol)
- **Coverage**: Belarus, 2000–2020
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Belarus.
2. **Selected relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted female and male alcohol consumption indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a dual-axis line graph comparing male vs. female consumption trajectories.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Female per capita consumption**: Remained relatively stable at low levels across the period, showing only slight variation.
- **Male per capita consumption**: Consistently four times higher than female levels, with sharper mid-period increases (2006–2012) followed by a decline, producing an inverted U-shaped pattern.
- **Comparison**: While both sexes experienced modest shifts, male consumption proved more volatile, suggesting greater responsiveness to external shocks or social dynamics.

## 5. Interpretation

- Belarus shows a persistent gender gap in alcohol consumption, with male levels substantially higher and more variable.
- The sharper fluctuations among men indicate that male drinking behaviors may be more closely tied to economic, social, or policy shifts, while female consumption patterns remain more stable.
- This highlights the importance of examining gendered consumption dynamics when assessing public health, social behavior, and long-term development trends.

## 6. Limitations

- The analysis is limited to two indicators; other relevant dimensions (e.g., health outcomes, income levels, rural-urban divides) are not captured.
- National averages obscure regional or demographic variations in consumption.
- The descriptive method does not explore causal mechanisms behind the observed patterns.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Investigate correlations between alcohol consumption and health outcomes, such as life expectancy or disease prevalence.
- Explore socioeconomic, regional, or cultural factors shaping the gender gap in drinking behaviors.
- Compare Belarus with other post-Soviet countries to evaluate whether similar gendered consumption patterns emerge.
- Assess the potential impact of policy interventions (e.g., taxation, regulation, awareness campaigns) on narrowing the male–female consumption gap.
